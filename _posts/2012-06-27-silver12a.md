title: ICML2011 Unsupervised and Transfer Learning Workshop
abstract: We organized a data mining challenge in “unsupervised and transfer learning”
  (the UTL challenge) followed by a workshop of the same name at the ICML 2011 conference
  in Bellevue, Washington. This introduction presents the highlights of the outstanding
  contributions that were made, which are regrouped in this issue of JMLR W&CP. Novel
  methodologies emerged to capitalize on large volumes of unlabeled data from tasks
  related (but different) from a target task, including a method to learn data kernels
  (similarity measures) and new deep architectures for feature learning.
