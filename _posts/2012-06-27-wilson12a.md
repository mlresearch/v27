title: 'Transfer Learning in Sequential Decision Problems:  A Hierarchical Bayesian
  Approach'
abstract: Transfer learning is one way to close the gap between the apparent speed
  of human learning and the relatively slow pace of learning by machines. Transfer
  is doubly beneficial in reinforcement learning where the agent not only needs to
  generalize from sparse experience, but also needs to efficiently explore. In this
  paper, we show that the hierarchical Bayesian framework can be readily adapted to
  sequential decision problems and provides a natural formalization of transfer learning.
  Using our framework, we produce empirical results in a simple colored maze domain
  and a complex real-time strategy game. The results show that our Hierarchical Bayesian
  Transfer framework significantly improves learning speed when tasks are hierarchically
  related.
