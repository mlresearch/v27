title: Unsupervised dimensionality reduction via gradient-based matrix factorization
  with two adaptive learning rates
abstract: "The high dimensionality of the data, the expressions of thousands of features
  in a much smaller number of samples, presents challenges that affect applicability
  of the analytical results. In principle, it would be better to describe the data
  in terms of a small number of meta-features, derived as a result of matrix factorization,
  which could reduce noise while still capturing the essential features of the data.
  Three novel and mutually relevant methods are presented in this paper: 1) gradient-based
  matrix factorization with two adaptive learning rates (in accordance with the number
  of factor matrices) and their automatic updates; 2) nonparametric criterion for
  the selection of the number of factors; and 3) nonnegative version of the gradient-based
  matrix factorization which doesn√¢\x80\x99t require any extra computational costs
  in difference to the existing methods. We demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed
  methods to the supervised classification of gene expression data."
