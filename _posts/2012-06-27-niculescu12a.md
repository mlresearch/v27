title: Inductive Transfer for Bayesian Network Structure Learning
abstract: 'We study the multi-task Bayesian Network structure learning problem: given
  data for multiple related problems, learn a Bayesian Network structure for each
  of them, sharing information among the problems to boost performance. We learn the
  structures for all the problems simultaneously using a score and search approach
  that encourages the learned Bayes Net structures to be similar. Encouraging similarity
  promotes information sharing and prioritizes learning structural features that explain
  the data from all problems over features that only seem relevant to a single one.
  This leads to a significant increase in the accuracy of the learned structures,
  especially when training data is scarce.'
