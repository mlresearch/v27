title: Information Theoretic Model Selection for Pattern Analysis
abstract: Exploratory data analysis requires (i) to define a set of patterns hypothesized
  to exist in the data, (ii) to specify a suitable quantification principle or cost
  function to rank these patterns and (iii) to validate the inferred patterns. For
  data clustering, the patterns are object partitionings into k groups; for PCA or
  truncated SVD, the patterns are orthogonal transformations with projections to a
  low-dimensional space. We propose an information theoretic principle for model selection
  and model-order selection. Our principle ranks competing pattern cost functions
  according to their ability to extract context sensitive information from noisy data
  with respect to the chosen hypothesis class. Sets of approximative solutions serve
  as a basis for a communication protocol. Analogous to ?, inferred models maximize
  the so-called approximation capacity that is the mutual information between coarsened
  training data patterns and coarsened test data patterns. We demonstrate how to apply
  our validation framework by the well-known Gaussian mixture model and by a multi-label
  clustering approach for role mining in binary user privilege assignments.
