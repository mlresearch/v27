title: Transfer Learning for Auto-gating of Flow Cytometry Data
abstract: Flow cytometry is a technique for rapidly quantifying physical and chemical
  properties of large numbers of cells. In clinical applications, flow cytometry data
  must be manually ``gated'' to identify cell populations of interest. While several
  researchers have investigated statistical methods for automating this process, most
  of them falls under the framework of unsupervised learning and mixture model fitting.
  We view the problem as one of transfer learning, which can leverage existing datasets
  previously gated by experts to automatically gate a new flow cytometry dataset while
  accounting for biological variation. We illustrate our proposed method by automatically
  gating lymphocytes from peripheral blood samples.
