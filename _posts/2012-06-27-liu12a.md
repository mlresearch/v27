title: Stochastic Unsupervised Learning on Unlabeled Data
abstract: In this paper, we introduce a stochastic unsupervised learning method that
  was used in the 2011 Unsupervised and Transfer Learning (UTL) challenge. This method
  is developed to preprocess the data that will be used in the subsequent classification
  problems. Specifically, it performs K-means clustering on principal components instead
  of raw data to remove the impact of noisy/irrelevant/less-relevant features and
  improve the robustness of the results. To alleviate the overfitting problem, we
  also utilize a stochastic process to combine multiple clustering assignments on
  each data point. Finally, promising results were observed on all the test data sets.
  Indeed, this proposed method won us the second place in the overall performance
  of the challenge.
