title: Multitask Learning in Computational Biology
abstract: Computational Biology provides a wide range of applications for Multitask
  Learning (MTL) methods. As the generation of labels often is very costly in the
  biomedical domain, combining data from different related problems or tasks is a
  promising strategy to reduce label cost. In this paper, we present two problems
  from sequence biology, where MTL was successfully applied. For this, we use regularization-based
  MTL methods, with a special focus on the case of a hierarchical relationship between
  tasks. Furthermore, we propose strategies to refine the measure of task relatedness,
  which is of central importance in MTL and finally give some practical guidelines,
  when MTL strategies are likely to pay off.
