title: 'Clustering: Science or Art?'
abstract: 'We examine whether the quality of different clustering algorithms can be
  compared by a general, scientifically sound procedure which is independent of particular
  clustering algorithms. We argue that the major obstacle is the difficulty in evaluating
  a clustering algorithm without taking into account the context: why does the user
  cluster his data in the first place, and what does he want to do with the clustering
  afterwards? We argue that clustering should not be treated as an application-independent
  mathematical problem, but should always be studied in the context of its end-use.
  Different techniques to evaluate clustering algorithms have to be developed for
  different uses of clustering. To simplify this procedure we argue that it will be
  useful to build a ``taxonomy of clustering problems'''' to identify clustering applications
  which can be treated in a unified way and that such an effort will be more fruitful
  than attempting the impossible -- developing ``optimal'''' domain-independent clustering
  algorithms or even classifying clustering algorithms in terms of how they work.'
