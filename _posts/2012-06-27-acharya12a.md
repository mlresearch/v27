title: Transfer Learning with Cluster Ensembles
abstract: Traditional supervised learning algorithms typically assume that the training
  data and test data come from a common underlying distribution. Therefore, they are
  challenged by the mismatch between training and test distributions encountered in
  transfer learning situations. The problem is further exacerbated when the test data
  actually comes from a different domain and contains no labeled example. This paper
  describes an optimization framework that takes as input one or more classifiers
  learned on the source domain as well as the results of a cluster ensemble operating
  solely on the target domain, and yields a consensus labeling of the data in the
  target domain. This framework is fairly general in that it admits a wide range of
  loss functions and classification/clustering methods. Empirical results on both
  text and hyperspectral data indicate that the proposed method can yield superior
  classification results compared to applying certain other transductive and transfer
  learning techniques or na\"{\i}vely applying the classifier (ensemble) learnt on
  the source domain to the target domain.
