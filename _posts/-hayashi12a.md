title: Self-measuring Similarity for Multi-task Gaussian Process
abstract: "Multi-task learning aims at transferring knowledge between similar tasks.
  The multi-task Gaussian process framework of Bonilla et al.Â models (incomplete)
  responses of C data points for R tasks (e.g., the responses are given by an R Ã\x97
  C matrix) by using a Gaussian process; the covariance function takes its form as
  the product of a covariance function defined on input-specific features and an inter-task
  covariance matrix (which is empirically estimated as a model parameter). We extend
  this framework by incorporating a novel similarity measurement, which allows for
  the representation of much more complex data structures. The proposed framework
  also enables us to exploit additional information (e.g., the input-specific features)
  when constructing the covariance matrices by combining additional information with
  the covariance function. We also derive an efficient learning algorithm which uses
  an iterative method to make predictions. Finally, we apply our model to a real data
  set of recommender systems and show that the proposed method achieves the best prediction
  accuracy on the data set."
