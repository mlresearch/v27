title: 'Divide and Transfer: an Exploration of Segmented Transfer to Detect Wikipedia
  Vandalism'
abstract: The paper applies knowledge transfer methods to the problem of detecting
  Wikipedia vandalism detection, defined as malicious editing intended to compromise
  the integrity of the content of articles. A major challenge of detecting Wikipedia
  vandalism is the lack of a large amount of labeled training data. Knowledge transfer
  addresses this challenge by leveraging previously acquired knowledge from a source
  task. However, the characteristics of Wikipedia vandalism are heterogeneous, ranging
  from a small replacement of a letter to a massive deletion of text. Selecting an
  informative subset from the source task to avoid potential negative transfer becomes
  a primary concern given this heterogeneous nature. The paper explores knowledge
  transfer methods to generalize learned models from a heterogeneous dataset to a
  more uniform dataset while avoiding negative transfer. The two novel segmented transfer
  (ST) approaches map unlabeled data from the target task to the most related cluster
  from the source task, classifying the unlabeled data using the most relevant learned
  models.
